xcode-tools
===========

Various xcode build, localization and iPhone-related scripts.
All of these scripts can easily be imported to fit in a bigger project.
Please take a look at the source code for further information.
These scripts are compatible with python 2.5 and 2.6, but mainly tested with
python 2.6.
Mac OS X is obviously the platform of choice for these tools, although the
code should be portable.


xcode_project.py
----------------
This script parses an [XCode][] project and gives access to all of its targets
and build settings.
If you run it, it will display the contents of the project file:

    $ python xcode_project.py App.xcodeproj
